    "In world of finance ratios are verhy important. I tells us how a company is doing in general and will it in future be profitbale of the investor. However, the accuarcy of these ratios are open to interpertation and how well stock market is doing. They can be deceivable and give false information to an investor. Therefore a much rigorious analysis is required when an investor is only using these ratios to create portfolios. \n",

    "In this assignment we like to examine how we can use only the raw data from companies to make investing decisons. We look at financial indicators (accounting information) of 4500 companies in NYSE. We will create a portfolio from the healthy companies to minimize our risk, and then use this portoflio to estimate a yearly return on a similar portfolio. \n",

    "* The data was taken from Kaggle website.\n",
    "* The  folder that was downloaded had 5 years of data. That is 5 \".csv\" files (2014-2018), each containing nearly to list of 4000 companies that are publicly traded on NYSE, and their yearly accounting information.\n",
    "* Putting together this data is very hard.\n",
    "* Due to how hard it must have been for the person gathering this information, and hlow companies redact certain information from their public statements for legal reasons, we did encounter discrepancies in our training exmaples. \n",
    "* We overcame by getting rid of companies that did not provide full information. As an investor, we prefer to to have access to full information."

    "### Approach\n",
    "We first needed to decide how to approach this problem. Since we had many training examples, BUT no labels, we decided to use clustering method. We used K-Means algorithm to create our final portfolio and then multiple linear regression to calcualted our retruns. What follows is how to get our optimum portfolio, that is healthy companies between 2014-2018."

    "Before we begin creating our clusters, let us see what value of K parameter is the best option for us. We will use the \"elbow method\" do find the best K value. The algorithm presented in class, was to loop through each K value iteratively and calculate the cost function. We then graph these values, and where there is an \"elbow\" we choose our K to be the tip of that elbow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to accept 2 sensible K values and use them for our clustering script. \n",
    "* We began by importing our data.\n",
    "* We then created two data frames. Both data frames will contain the features we need, but the difference will be that one of these dataframes will be normalized.\n",
    "* We then ran our iterative loop for K values for both dataframes, saved the K and their corresponding cost values and created a plot to represent them.\n",
    "* At the end we added the ratios to the normalized dataframe and did the same iterative step.\n",

    "We have a list of healthy companies during 2018. This is not a large list, however it is larger than the other years, when we change our years. One reason to why we have a large portfoio, can be that 2018 was a very volatile year. According to CNBC finances, the stock market S&P500 fell more than 6% during the year. When market is volatile then there is more chance to create arbitrage. We also need to keep in mind that this is only for 2018. This does not mean that revenues have grown from last year. All we ar saying is these stocks were healthy in 2018, and it is highly possible that they will stay that way for a period of time. "
