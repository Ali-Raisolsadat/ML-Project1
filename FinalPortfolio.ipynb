    "## A Glimpse of Machine Learning in Finances\n",
    "#### By David Thompson and Ali Raisolsadat\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of finances, accounting and financial ratios are very important. They tells us how a company is doing in general and will it, in future be profitable to an investor. However, the meaning of some of these ratios are open to interpretation and they can be unwary by giving false information to an investor. Therefore, a much more rigorous analysis is required to optimize a portfolio that is risk averse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we like to examine how we can use only the raw accounting information from companies to make investing decisions. We look at financial indicators (accounting information) of nearly 4000 companies in NYSE (New York Stock Exchange). We will create a portfolio of the healthy companies to minimize our risk, and then use this portfolio to estimate a yearly return on a similar portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with fundamental ideas here with our notebook and in the paper we will view them more carefully and more in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The following is a summary analysis of the data we used for this assignment:\n",
    "* The data was taken from Kaggle website.\n",
    "* The  folder that was downloaded had 5 years of data. That is 5 \".csv\" files (2014-2018), each containing nearly to list of 4000 companies that are publicly traded on NYSE, and their yearly accounting information.\n",
    "* Putting together this data is very hard.\n",
    "* Due to how hard it must have been for the person gathering this information, and how companies redact certain information from their public statements for legal reasons, we did encounter discrepancies in our training examples. \n",
    "* We overcame this by getting rid of companies that did not provide full information. As an investor, we prefer to have access to as much as information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach and Models\n",
    "We have devised two models for this project. There will be a description of our approach, comments along the way to address why we get a certain result, and at the end there will be a description about our model's final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "One model considers the health of companies and the other tries to predict the future returns on the stock of the healthy companies. In our first model we used K clustering to decide which of the companies provided are healthy or not healthy. We created different clusters that contained certain number of stocks, and we took the \"best\" clusters to create a portfolio of healthy companies. In our second model, we took an example of 5 companies from our list of healthy companies and tried to predict their yearly returns. However we hit a road block as we did not have enough data instances to move forward with our return predictions. With all the preliminaries introduced, let us dive into the project and see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Model\n",
    "Since we had many training examples, BUT no labels, we decided to use a clustering method. We used K-Means algorithm to create our final master portfolio. What follows is how to get our optimum portfolio, that is, healthy companies between years 2014-2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin creating our clusters, let us see what value of K parameter is the best option for us. We will use the \"elbow method\" to find the best K value. The algorithm presented in class, was to loop through each K value iteratively and calculate the cost function. We then graph these values, and where there is an \"elbow\" we choose our K to be the tip of that elbow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to accept 2 sensible K values and use them for our clustering script. \n",
    "* We began by importing our data.\n",
    "* We then created two data frames. Since our data contains very large numbers, then it is a good idea to normalize before we proceed with our elbow method.\n",
    "    * One data frame will only contain our raw normalized features.\n",
    "    * The second data frame will have both our raw features and 6 financial ratios.\n",
    "* We then ran our iterative loop for K values for both dataframes, saved the K and their corresponding cost values and created a plot to represent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that we will only normalize the data for the elbow method. We will use the raw data instances for the K clusters. Let us see the results."

    "$K = 4$ and $K = 5$ we can get good clusters from the data given to us. We can also use $K=3$ but we need to bring the amount of risk as low as possible. In other words we like to be risk averse, even in finding the healthy companies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now the question will be how do we choose the best cluster from different $K$ values. We have high dimension data ($>$3D), so we cannot examine them visually. Therefore we need to use a feature as an indicator that belongs to a healthy company. We know that a good company has high revenues. High revenue indicates that a company is managing its wealth very well, has a good marketing department, and is able to pay outstanding debt at the end of the year. We could use net income as well, but there are some issues with using only net income. We will further discuss these issues in the project paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "High revenue however, does not mean a company is healthy, as we are ACTUALLY trying to find the healthy companies using clustering. It only means that a company's stock will be higher at the end of the year, since there is more demand for the stock as this is highly correlated with high revenue. These will be our \"healthy\" stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Another good measure will be using \"Gross profit\", specially if an investor is looking for a high dividends return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this by creating a loop to get us each year's group of healthy stocks. This loop cycles through each year collecting the best group of stocks then eventually creates a master portfolio from all of the groups combined."

We only have access to one year of financial data through the base data set. We can look into alternative models but at the end we will have the same problem. However it is intereting to see that the model tends to follow positive or negative returns on predictions with respect to the historical returns. Unfortunatley this is not enough for the return on our final portfolio returns as it is evident by the numbers represented.

This will bring down the risk of misinterpreting the financial ratios, specially for a beginner investor. We also saw that un-variate regression is not a good model to predict the future yearly returns on stock due to lack of training examples, which also results on an excess amount of overfitting. \n",
