    "In world of finance ratios are verhy important. I tells us how a company is doing in general and will it in future be profitbale of the investor. However, the accuarcy of these ratios are open to interpertation and how well stock market is doing. They can be deceivable and give false information to an investor. Therefore a much rigorious analysis is required when an investor is only using these ratios to create portfolios.\n",

    "In this assignment we like to examine how we can use only the raw data from companies to make investing decisons. We look at financial indicators (accounting information) of 4500 companies in NYSE. We will create a portfolio from the healthy companies to minimize our risk, and then use this portoflio to estimate a yearly return on a similar portfolio.\n",

    "The following is a quick analysis of the data we used for this assignment:\n",
    "* The data was taken from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "* The folder that was downloaded has 5 years of data. That is 5 \".csv\" files.\n",
    "* We have selected this dataset for the purpose of predicting which companies would be healthy and relatively safe companies to invest in. \n",
    "* Inside these files are 4000+ companies each having 250 features. \n",
    "* Each of these features provides different financial information on each company.\n",
    "* Not all of these features are relevant or useful to us in this assignment so we have selected 17 features that pertain to our goal."

    "### Approach\n",
    "We first needed to decide how to approach this problem. Since we had many training examples, BUT no labels, we decided to use clustering method. We used K-Means algorithm to create our final portfolio and then multiple linear regression to calcualted our retruns. What follows is how to get our optimum portfolio, that is healthy companies between 2014-2018."

    "Before we begin creating our clusters, let us see what value of K parameter is the best option for us. We will use the \"elbow method\" do find the best K value. The algorithm presented in class, was to loop through each K value iteratively and calculate the cost function. We then graph these values, and where there is an \"elbow\" we choose our K to be the tip of that elbow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to accept 2 sensible K values and use them for our clustering script. \n",
    "* We began by importing our data.\n",
    "* We then created two data frames. Both data frames will contain the features we need, but the difference will be that one of these dataframes will be normalized.\n",
    "* We then ran our iterative loop for K values for both dataframes, saved the K and their corresponding cost values and created a plot to represent them.\n",
    "* At the end we added the ratios to the normalized dataframe and did the same iterative step.\n",

    "$K = 4$ and $K = 5$ we can get good clusters from the data given to us. We can also use $K=3$ but we need to bring the amount of risk as low as possible. In other words we like to be risk averse, even in finding the healthy companies.\n",

    "Now the question will be how do we choose the best cluster from differnet $K$ values. We have high dimenstion data ($>$3D), so we cannot examine them visually. Therefore we need to use a feature as an indicator that belongs to a healthy company. We know that a good company has high revenues. High revenue indicates that a company is managing its wealth very well, has a good marketing department and is able to pay outstanding debt at the end of the year. We can also use net income as well but there are some issues with only using net income. We will further dicuss these issues in the project paper.\n",

    "High revenue, however, does not mean a company is healthy, as we are ACTUALLY trying to find the healthy companies using clustering. It only means that a company's stock will be higher at the end of the year, since there is more demand for the stock as this is highly correlated with high revenue. This will be our \"healthy\" stocks. \n",

    "We have a list of healthy companies during 2018. This is not a large list, however it is larger than the other years, when we change our years. One reason to why we have a large portfoio, can be that 2018 was a very volatile year. According to CNBC finances, the stock market S&P500 fell more than 6% during the year. When market is volatile then there is more chance to create arbitrage. We also need to keep in mind that this is only for 2018. This does not mean that revenues have grown from last year. All we ar saying is these stocks were healthy in 2018, and it is highly possible that they will stay that way for a period of time. "
